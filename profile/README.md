# The Applied Research Studio (T.A.R.S)
If you're reading this it means you, for some reason or another, found us as AI specialists for getting _real work_ done.

In modern software engineering there are no silver bullets, and the cost of making mistakes is higher than ever. 

TARS works on projects across departments, industries and business types. TARS works on projects for fun. TARS works on applying frontier innovation to the real world. 

We're a company that operates independently of 'individuals' by working in an AI-native way. That means for some projects we're 1 human, for others we're 3. We're the namesake of TARS from [Interstellar](https://interstellarfilm.fandom.com/wiki/TARS), a former U.S. Marine Corps tactical robots that helps the crew reach their goals.

Just like in the movie, we operate by staying reliable, open to feedback and acting with high agency.
